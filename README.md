## ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±

ToPWR to aplikacja mobilna stworzona przez studentÃ³w, dla studentÃ³w Politechniki WrocÅ‚awskiej. Licznik dni do sesji, mapka kampusu, informacje o dziekanatach, koÅ‚ach naukowych i licznik wolnych miejsc parkingowych na Å¼ywo â€“ wszystko, co trzeba, w jednym miejscu. Life made easy. ðŸš€

ToPWR to efekt naszych doÅ›wiadczeÅ„ i pomysÅ‚Ã³w, ktÃ³rymi chcielibyÅ›my siÄ™ podzieliÄ‡ z innymi studentami. Bo przecieÅ¼ kaÅ¼dy z nas zaczynaÅ‚ od zera, wiÄ™c dlaczego nie stworzyÄ‡ czegoÅ›, co uÅ‚atwiÅ‚oby Å¼ycie na uczelni? ZaleÅ¼aÅ‚o nam, aby kaÅ¼dy student miaÅ‚ w kieszeni takiego kumpla, ktÃ³ry go wspiera i pomaga ogarnÄ…Ä‡ to wszystko. Bo studia to nie tylko nauka, to takÅ¼e odkrywanie, poznawanie, czasem trochÄ™ gubienie siÄ™ â€“ i to jest w porzÄ…dku.

## ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

ToPWR is a mobile application created by the students, for the students of WrocÅ‚aw University of Science and Technology. A countdown to exams, a campus map, information about dean's offices, student science clubs, and a live counter for available parking spots â€“ everything you need in one place. Life made easy. ðŸš€

ToPWR is the result of our experiences and ideas, which we want to share with other students. After all, each of us started from scratch, so why not create something that makes university life easier? We wanted every student to have a companion in their pocket, supporting and helping them manage everything. Because uni life is not just about studying; it's also about discovering, meeting new people, sometimes getting a little lost, and that's okay.

## Project history

The app was initially created by KN Solvro members using native mobile technologies (Android & iOS) and a Strapi backend in 2022 (v0.5.1 was released on October 3, 2022).

Now, we're redesigning and remaking it with exciting new features using Flutter and Directus CMS, and weâ€™re after our first release (26/09/2024)! ðŸš€.

# Development

Recommended flutter version: `Channel stable, 3.24.0`

1. ### Before you start, you need to add `.env` file to project's root with appropriate content:

```bash
API_URL="https://<our-server-url>/graphql"
ASSETS_URL="https://<our-server-url>/assets"
IPARKING_URL="https://<secret parking's source>.pl"
WIREDASH_ID="<...>" # can be left empty
WIREDASH_SECRET="<...>" # can be left empty
SKS_URL="https://<...>/api/v1"
DIGITAL_GUIDE_URL="https://<...>/api"
DIGITAL_GUIDE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN="<...>"
DIGITAL_GUIDE_URL_MICRONAVIGATION="<...>"
```
If you need our server url please write us an email [kn.solvro@pwr.edu.pl](mailto:kn.solvro@pwr.edu.pl) or contact us via our [website](https://solvro.pwr.edu.pl/contact/)

  ### Code generation
  Some of app's dependecies utilize code generation feature and generated files **are not currently included** to control version and this github repository, so before building, running or developing application, it's crucial to run code generation (to generate all needed files) in terminal with:

- For one-time generation:

```zsh
dart run build_runner build
```

**OR**

- For watch mode and continous necessary rebuilds after every change to connected files (usufull for development):

```zsh
dart run build_runner watch
```

- If something doesn't build correctly, this might help:

```zsh
dart run build_runner build -d
```

2.  ### It's now possible to run or build the app in the usual way
    _Rebuilds are necessary after any updates or changes to affected files (`watch` command does it for you)_
   - Either with your IDE or
   - from Terminal:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

3. ### SVGO
    For SVG files optimization we use `svg_optimizer` (which uses SVGO under the hood) that's why before you start you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) and [SVGO optimization tool](https://svgo.dev/docs/introduction/) on your machine


4. **[OPTIONAL]** If you operate on many Flutter versions, I reccomend to you `fvm` Flutter version manager: https://fvm.app/
```bash
fvm dart run build_runner watch
fvm flutter run
// etc...
```
    

### Additional notes:

1. App's custom theme usage instructions: https://github.com/Solvro/topwr-mobile/tree/main/lib/theme
2. Introductions to internationalizing flutter apps (making them available in different languages): https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility-and-internationalization/internationalization
3. Api helper module instructions: https://github.com/Solvro/topwr-mobile/tree/main/lib/api_base
4. We use `flutter_gen` for generating asset paths: https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gen 
5. For unified names read and follow: [taxonomy.md](./taxonomy.md)
6. For navigation we use `auto_route`, docs here: https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route
7. For SVG files optimization we use `svg_optimizer` (which uses SVGO under the hood), related article here: https://www.thedroidsonroids.com/blog/svg-open-source-flutter-package

# Before you push a commit
- run the linter
```bash
flutter analyze
```
- if you have any problems listed, try to autofix with
```bash
dart fix --apply
```
- run `analyze` again, if problems still persist, correct them manually. If you disagree with some of the rules, we can still discuss and adjust them. Hit me up @simon-the-shark or open an issue.
- run formatter
```bash
dart format .
```
- run riverpod linter (and any other custom lint package)
```bash
dart run custom_lint
```
## Github workflow
Don't worry if you've forgotten about the steps, automatic gh action will run the checks for you and notify if somthing's wrong.


## Working with git

### Github Solvro Handbook ðŸ”¥

https://docs.solvro.pl/guides/github

### SSH

Connecting to Github(Gh) repository via SSH on Windows, tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vExsOTgIOGw

### Building new feature

1. git checkout main -> checkout main branch
2. git pull origin main -> pull current changes from main branch
3. git fetch -> be up to date with remote branches
4. git checkout -b MOBILE-x_my_feature_branch -> x - stands for issue number; it is going to checkout and create new branch name MOBILE-x_my_feature_branch
   (... working on the feature, we are still on our branch named MOBILE-x_my_feature_branch)
5. git add . -> add all changes we have made
6. git commit -m "My changes description" -> commit made changes with proper description
7. git push origin MOBILE-x_my_feature_branch -> pushing our changes to remote branch
8. On Github we are going to make Pull Request (PR) from our remote branch

### Remarks

- Do not push directly to main branch!!! This is bad practice!
- local branch - is our branch on our computer not on the server if we do some chagnes and do checkout to diffrent branch without saving them(commiting) we might loose them, commit before checkout to different branch!
- remote branch - this is branch with our code in github's servers
- After code review which was successful, we can merge from our feature branch to main branch. After merging we should clean after ourself.

1. git branch -d MOBILE-x_my_feature_branch -> deletes our local branch
2. git push origin --delete MOBILE-x_my_feature_branch -> delete our remote branch
